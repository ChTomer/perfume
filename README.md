# perfume

So this is the second time I'm trying to work on CSS for this website (https://www.frontendmentor.io/)
I feel that I lost something in the middle of the work here.
First, if you will try to zoom in, you will see that the text box covers the picture.

Second, for some (weird) reason I lost the 'cart' icon, and I don't know how to be able to find it again. It is something with an SVG file. 

I would like to have comments and notes if you fInd some time to write a few words and help.

Thank you for reading this readme file.
